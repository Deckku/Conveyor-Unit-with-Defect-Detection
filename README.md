# Conveyor-Unit-with-Defect-Detection
A mini conveyor system with a Raspberry Pi 4 and YOLO model for real-time defect detection. It classifies pieces as defective or non-defective using a camera feed. Validated in Factory IO simulation and implemented in a real-life prototype for automated quality control.
